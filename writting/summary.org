阅读部分提炼处观点(总结提炼依据,切勿找成support & detail，否则后面会与听力当中出现的点对不上)
main point多出现在首段段尾
sub point多出现在子段段首, 自查sub point的方法是判断是否支持main point
之后在写作时
*首段中*
思路一： 第一句话说明阅读部分的main point对所有sub point都是有好处的，紧接着第二句说明听力部分是反驳main point的观点
思路二： 完全以lecture的角度去说，然后说用万能废话说lecture与passage的观点是完全不同的，例如：
He says that the theory stated in the passage was very different and somewhat inaccurate when compared to
what happened in reality.
*子段中*中每一段的第一句话概括一个sub point，之后用听力中听到的细节部分来对其进行具体的解释说明
