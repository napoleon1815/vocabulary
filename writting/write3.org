The representation of the woman's face is very much like that of portraits known to be by Rembrandt.

2. the representation of ... 
3. be very much like 非常像
4. that of portraits 那些自画像中的

The face appears to be illuminated by light reflected onto it from below.
1. The face appears to 面庞呈现出
2. be illuminated by light 被光照亮了
3. reflected onto it from below 来自下面反射到脸上到光(it -> face)

But below the face is the dark fur collar, which would absorb light rather than reflect it.
So the face should appear partially in shadow.

The inconsistency between the white cap, which identifies the woman as a servant, and the expensive fur collar
she wears dissolves (as the Professor explains that the fur colar was apparently painted over the original
painting to increase its worth by displaying an aristocratic woman.)

The mystery of the panel consisting of patches glued together is also solved in the lecture.

*In terms of* whether a painting "protrait of an elderly woman in a white bonnet" was indeed a work of
Rembrandt, *the speaker and writer holded the contradictory.* So begin with the wirtting suggests that
*the white cap didn't fit the luxurious fur collar* since the cap was very cheap. The listening, however,
states that *by x-ray and analyzing the pigment of the painting*, the reasearh found that *the fur collar*
*was added onto the top of the painting*. Hunderad years after it was finished *for the purpose of increasing*
*is value by making the woman look like a very airstocratic lady*. In addition, the reading alleges that
*Rembrandt was skilled in handling light and shadow which in this painting doesn't well match*. *By removing*
*the added fur collar the original could be showing up* the woman was just wearing a light colour cloth
which could reflect that illuminating part of the woman's face. Finally the writer advocates that
the painting was made/painted on *a panel made of pieces of wood ranther than a single piece* *is*
*refuted/repudiated by the listening which declare that* the original painting is in fact created on a single
piece of wood after other investigation. It turns out that the pieces of wood in the original painting is
from the very same tree as the wood panel used for another painting.
