In terms of the four-day workweek policy would be good or not ( option ?), the view points of the lecture and
pessage are contradictry. The pessage suggests that the new policy would benefit the entire/whole country,
indiviual company, as well as employees. The lecture, however, argues that the new policy would benefit none
of them.

To begin with, the writer insists that the new policy would *benefit the company for* their employees
( would be well reseted and energitic, more efficient in their jobs ?), the lecturer holds that the new policy
would *increse the company cost in order to make up the workloads differency/disparity(工作量的差异)*
the company would hire more staffs *who are supposed to be trained and provided with health cared*,
the company also has to purchase new work facility. All would *cut into company profit*.

In addition, *the writer advocates that* the new policy would *cut the unemployment rate* since the company
would employ more workers to *fill the workloads gap(工作量的差异)*. *The speaker, nontheless, matians that*
no jobs would become available *after excution of the new policy* because that the company would *raise
its expection*, *asking their staffs to finish their four days workloads they used to do in five days*.

Finally, *the passage put forward that the new policy would benefit employees since they will get more*
*free time to stay with their family and persure their private intersts, but the lecturer points out that*
*the new policy would end up decreasing the staffs life quality.* *On one hand*, it would jeopardise the
employees carrer advancement(职业晋升), for it would harm the workers performance in their jobs and the company
would choose supviser from employees who work for five days to keep the work insistence; *On the other hand*,
the four days workweek employees would become the first one losing(动名词修饰前面n) their job, in particular,
during on economic downtern.
